IPA-Keypad
==========

A tool to help input of Unicode IPA symbols.

This is a very old project that will probably get a bit of a revamp in the future. Gone are my days of teaching English and therefore gone is the need for this tool to input phonemic script, but if anyone is interested in a new version, I will be happy to try and get it cleaned up and running a bit better.
